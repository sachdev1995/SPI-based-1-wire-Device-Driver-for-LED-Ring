2) Then compile the code using - make
3) This will create spi_platform_device.ko and spi_tester
4) Transfer the code to board using -
	scp spi_platform_device.ko spi_tester BOARD_IP:/home/root
5) On board follow following steps -

	i) insmod spi_platform_device.ko
	ii) ./spi_tester
	

User Program to drive -

This programs open the character driver and send the RGB color data to the character driver write function
You can change the Number of LED data to send by -  set data.n = <NUMBER_OF_LED>
You can change  the RGB color  to send to each LED - set data[<LED_NUMBER>].green, data[<LED_NUMBER>].red, data[<LED_NUMBER>].blue
